    Financial accounts resource for connecting and managing payout destinations.

    Financial accounts represent bank accounts, mobile money wallets, or Dosh accounts
    where you receive payouts. Before you can receive funds from Inttegro, you must connect
    and verify at least one financial account, then configure it as a payout destination.

    The typical flow is:
    1. Connect a financial account (bank_account, mobile money, or dosh_account)
    2. Verify ownership via OTP
    3. Set as payout destination via Payouts resource
    4. Receive automatic or manual payouts

    See https://studio.inttegro.com/set-up-financial-account for detailed guides.
