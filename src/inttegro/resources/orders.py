    Orders resource for creating orders, processing payments, and managing order lifecycle.

    Orders are the central transaction object in Inttegro. They represent a purchase with
    line items, customer information, and payment details. Use this resource to create
    orders, charge customers, handle confirmations, and process refunds.

    The typical order flow is:
    1. Create order with line items and customer details
    2. Pay order with a payment method (may require OTP confirmation)
    3. Finalize order to make it available in reporting
    4. Complete order when fulfillment is done (optional)

    Order operations return typed domain models. The HTTP response envelope is
    decoded internally and does not leak into the public resource API.

    See https://studio.inttegro.com/orders for detailed guides.

        Cancels an order that hasn't been paid yet. Once cancelled, the order cannot be
        paid or modified. This is useful for abandonment flows, expired carts, or when
        customers explicitly cancel before payment.

        You cannot cancel orders that have been paid. Use refund() instead for paid orders.
