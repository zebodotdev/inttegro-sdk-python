    Payment methods resource for securely storing and managing payment instruments.

    Payment methods represent saved payment instruments (mobile money accounts, bank
    cards, etc.) that customers can reuse for faster checkout. Tokenization converts
    sensitive payment details into a secure token that you can safely store and charge
    repeatedly without handling raw payment credentials.

    The typical flow is:
    1. Tokenize payment details to create a payment method
    2. Verify the payment method (triggers OTP for mobile money)
    3. Confirm verification with OTP
    4. Use the payment method ID for future charges

    See https://studio.inttegro.com/charge-repeat-customers for detailed guides.

        future charges without requiring the customer to re-enter payment details.

        Mobile money payment methods require verification before use. After tokenization,
