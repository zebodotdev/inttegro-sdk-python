"""Models, requests, and enums for the Inttegro refund resource.

The primary returned object is ``inttegro.refund.Refund``. Related request types, nested response shapes, and string-backed enums are exported from this singular namespace. Public members load lazily, so importing one resource does not eagerly import the entire SDK."""
