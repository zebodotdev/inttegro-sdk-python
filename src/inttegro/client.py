    Example:
        ```python
        import os
        from inttegro import InttegroClient

        # Initialize client with API key
        client = InttegroClient(api_key=os.environ["INTTEGRO_API_KEY"])

        # Create and process an order
        result = client.orders.create({
            "customer_data": {
                "name": "Akua Asantewaa",
                "phone_number": "+233541234567",
                "email_address": "akua@example.com"
            },
            "line_items": [{
                "type": "product",
                "product": {
                    "type": "digital",
                    "name": "Premium Subscription",
                    "quantity": 1,
                    "price": {"currency": "ghs", "value": 5000}
                }
            }],
            "billing_details": {
                "name": "Akua Asantewaa",
                "phone_number": "+233541234567"
            },
            "execute_payment": True
        })
        ```

    Thread Safety:
        The client is thread-safe after initialization and can be safely shared
        across multiple threads.

        Initialize a new Inttegro client.

        Args:
            api_key: Your Inttegro API key (required). Get this from your dashboard
                at https://studio.inttegro.com/settings/keys. Use test keys (sk_test_...)
                for development and live keys (sk_live_...) for production.
            base_url: API base URL. Defaults to production (https://api.inttegro.com).
                Override for testing or staging environments.
            timeout: Request timeout in seconds. Defaults to 30.0. Increase for
                long-running operations or slow networks.
            transport: Custom HTTP transport adapter. Pass a requests.Session or
                custom transport for connection pooling, retries, or proxies.
            telemetry_enabled: Emit spans to the configured OpenTelemetry provider.
                Defaults to True. The SDK never configures an exporter.
